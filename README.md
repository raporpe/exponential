## About Raúl Portugués

I'm a Barcelona-based engineer with a diverse background across the tech ecosystem: from working in the field as a forward-deployed engineer to connecting datacenters to Microsoft’s cloud, driving $5M/year in Azure revenue, and evolving into a full-fledged Software Engineer.

Right now I'm in the Microsoft AI org, where my team is rethinking the native Bing app experience to turn it into an AI-powered search experience.

Outside of work, I build small, focused products that solve concrete problems in everyday life, experimenting with design, data, and cloud infrastructure.

## Why Exponential

Over the next few years, I want to:
1. Level up as an engineer by learning from world-class builders.  
2. Build products that reach users and actually make a difference.  
3. Understand the DNA of great startups — from tech decisions to product intuition.  
4. Learn what is takes to found and scale a company.

I'm not chasing fancy titles — just meaningful work.
